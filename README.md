# weather-dashboard

My project that i built is a weather dashboard. this weather dashboard will show you a couple different things about the weather conditions of the decided city you decide to type. i built this to improve my skills as a web developer and experiment with different apis. My project works by typing in the decided city in the search bar and clicking search once searched a set of conditions will show up about the city you searched including, what city, temperature in the city, humidity, wind and a descirption of the conditions.
